#### The folder contains compiled binary and Hex files. Some programmers only work with one of these file types.</br>
&emsp; **NRFCL0X.BIN** and **NRFCL0X.HEX** are respectively binary and Hex files for flashing the programmer of all NRF24LE1 circuit breakers (clients) in the system. After
NRF24LE1 firmware starts on channel 125 with RFID=16, livolo protocol and true/false states. After connecting to the gateway in its web you need to change
These parameters are necessary, first RFID, then everything else. After changing any parameter, NRF24LE1 restarts. Then flash and connect the next switch. If the current parameters of NRF24LE1 are unknown, then you can short-circuit port p0.6 to ground and apply power. The chip will return all these parameters to their default values. After which you need to remove the jumper, otherwise it will be impossible to write new parameters.</br>
&emsp; **NRFSRVH.BIN** and **NRFSRVH.HEX** binary and Hex files for flashing the NRF24LE1 gateway microcircuit programmer. The firmware supports the NRF24LE1 with or without the RFX2401C amplifier. After flashing the nrf24le1 firmware, the gateway also starts on channel 125.</br>
&emsp; **NRF_NRFCL0X.BIN** and **NRF_NRFSRVH.BIN** - files for updating if it is necessary to flash the switch and gateway firmware from the web in already assembled devices. They can be obtained from the **NRFCL0X.BIN** and **NRFSRVH.BIN** files using the **NRCRC.EXE** program from the **other** folder.</br>
&emsp; **fespnrf.bin** binary firmware file for a gateway chip programmer ESP-01(ESP8266) with 1 MB memory and is flashed in one file from address 0x0000 to a clean ESP. Then you need to create a guest Wi-Fi network in the router with ssid "espnrf" and password "12345678", wait until the ESP connects to it, enter the ESP IP address in the web and set the remaining parameters in the Setting tab. After which the guest network is no longer needed. The ESP will only attempt to connect to the "espnrf" network if the main network is unavailable, for example if the password is incorrect. If it cannot connect to the guest network, the ESP reboots.</br>
&emsp; **espnrf.bin** file for updating, if necessary, ESP firmware from the web in an already assembled gateway. In addition to gateway support, the firmware can control two relays using two additional buttons or via Mqtt. Tested to work with wifi relay [QS-WIFI-S03-2](https://aliexpress.ru/item/33048104300.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.274233edQYdkZw). In the settings you need to set: button1 - 13, Button2 - 12, relay1 - 14, relay2 - 15.
